# Christianity
## Introduction
	Church   Christianity = power from above
		vs.
	mystical Christianity = power from within

Jesus, God
 
**Sources?**

- old testament
- Bible
- **Apostles** - Gospels => interpretation

Interpretation of interpretation = *extremely subjective*

**Gospels**

- good news
- Luke, Mark, Matthew, John
- written in Greek
- wrapped together in Old Testament
- Old Testament (in Hebrew) + New Testament (in Greek) = Bible
- **authoritative perception**: perceived as the true interpretation ≠ only interpretation
	- Apocryphal gospels => other versions

Jesus

- in Galilee
- a man, human being
- part Divine - come to help other become divine => *Gnostic*
- man exalted by God => *adoptionist*
- a God man - unique

### Church - signs
- cross
- sin
- Jesus - Saviour
	- depicted as a pale, bearded, long-hair man (no particular traits)
	- salvation
- sacrement (in catholic religion):
	- **baptism**
		- accepted and reborn in the church of Christ
	- **communion**
		- Eucharist
	- confirmation
	- marriage
	- extreme unction
	- ordination
	- penance
	- requires a **clergy** => gives more power to the church
	- Holy spirit
- church
	- designed to look like a boat, symbolizing the voyage through life and after life
- church christianity = hierarchical structure (apostolic succession) ≠ mystical christianity
	- Apostolic succession - Holy spirit -> Jesus -> clergy -> believers  
	\- create a uniformity of voice within the christian religion
- sacramentalism
- Constantine - he and the church were both searching for power to unite
- **Nicaean creed** puts an end to the discussion of who Jesus truly was, and bestows the church the power that they desired

## Church Christianity - Ch3, 4
=> **power from above**  
**Eastern Orthodoxy**  

##### decline / collapse of Western Roman Empire  => Power vacuum => papacy (Pope in place of Emperor)  
=> strengthen the power of the church


**Christendom**  

- kingdom
- church in every town under Charlemagne 

*1414* Council of Constance

- puts an end to the divergence of 2 different popes
- Martin V => first uncontested pope
- re-built Rome <= sold **indulgences** for finance - a trade in salvation

*March 1517*

- initiated the construction of Saint Peter's basilica with the gain from indulgences

*October 1517*

- Martin Luther - German monk: 95 thesis
	- struck by the issuing of the **indulgences** - nothing to do with religion - far away from original teachings of Christianity
	- utilized the **printing press** to spread his impact (invented in 1450) - a lot of copies at the time
	- "I did nothing. The word did everything."
	- translated Bible from latin into German - natural language => enabled more people that don't know latin to read the Bible without priests / monks
- wanted Christianity to go back in the fundamentals + correct the derivations of the religion
- rejected the idea of the pope + priests

=> protestant reformation

### Protestant reformation
Martin Luther -> moved away from Roman catholic church + disagreement within christianity -> new council / decree (ex. council of Nicaea)

=> catholic counter-reformation 

- aims to minimize the impact of the  protestant reformation and other movement

*The council of Trent* lasted for 18 years from 1545 which restudied the basics of the Roman catholic church. 

=> rebranding (to make up the impact of Luther) - fundamentally little change

yet quite effective : 1 / 3 re-converted

**The Roman inquisition**

- all of the works of Luther and other protestant and humanist works are considered as heretic and banned
- very effective: 1 / 3 of the people who moved away re-converted to the roman catholic church
- => led to later religious wars

## printing => Biblical Christianity
relied mainly on the Bible + w/o the middleman of the priest

## Mythical Christianity
- no middleman of the priest  
- non of the rituals / sacrements of the church christianity
- => **power form within**
- much more critical of the Church's role in the society + its search for power and wealth
- relies more on the spirit than the world 
- *Desert fathers* -> very first mythical christians - lived in solitude, hardly ate, aimed to achieve the the initial spiritual perfection of Adam and Eve in the Garden (w/o relying on much food or sleep) - a bit extremist
- led to **monasticism**
- _The alliance between the Church and the Empire reinforced the mystical suspicion of Church christianity that they followed the pure spiritual path and betrayed the original message._
- It undermined the **power** + hierarchy of the church, undermined the **power** and influence of the Pope and priests
	- as the mythical christianity had no needs of the sacrements and hence the church

- Solution: chooses monks and brings the mythical christianity / monasticism closer to Church christianity
	- mythical christianity adopts the Bible and other aspects of Church christianity
	- mythical and church christianity are merged together => few differences 
	- less pure monastic mythical christianity
	- **Benedict Rule**
		- pray and work

## Conclusion
- `Church` vs `mythical` christianity
- `Christianity` vs `Catholicism`

What had a strong impact on the modern western society is **christianity**, not only Catholicism. 

- `protestantism` vs `catholicism`
	- `protestantism`:
		- priests can be married, have a family
		- women can participate

## *Women in Christianity*
**Masculin bias** at the `Creation` already:

- Adam and Eve
	- Adam was made from the hands of God
	- Eve was made from a rib of Adam
	- -> implication: women are dependent on women, men over women (God > Adam > Eve)
	- Eve was the one who took the apple
	- -> implication: women's appetite which leads to the fall of humans

### Language and Imagery
In Bible:  
Jesus, King, lord, judge, etc. -> male

no or few feminine vocabulary to refer to women

=> **masculin bias**

### BUT
- Churches: only public place women were allowed to go
- "traditional" women values can be transposed from family to church
- a way to gain independence and escape forced mariages
- Women tended to be more active in church

=> Women were particularly attracted to christianity **because of** the masculin despise. 

-> nowadays, women are attracted to christianity in areas lacking development.
